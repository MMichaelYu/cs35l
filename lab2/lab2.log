1.export LC_ALL='C'
	This changes locale to the correct settings.
2.cd /usr/share/dict
	This moves to directory where the words file is located.
3.sort -o ~/cs35l/lab2/words words
        Creates a words file in my working directory that is a sorted version of
	words.
4.cd ~/cs35l/lab2
	I move back to the working directory.
5.wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html 
        This copies assign2.html into my working directory.
6.cat <assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
      	This replaces anything that's not an alphabetical character with a new
	line.
7.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
        This works like the above except any new lines in a row are squeezed
	together into only one new line.
8.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
        Now the output from the previous command is sorted by ASCII order.
9.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
        This is the same output from the before command but without any repeated
	entries.
10.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' ' [\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
        This compares the two files and outputs three columns. The first
	contains entries unique to assign2.html, the second contains entries
	unique to words, and the third contains entries that appear in both
	files.
11.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
        This outputs the same as the above command but omits the second and
	third column. So only entries that appear in assign2.html and not in
	words appear.
12.wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm
	This puts hwnwdseng.htm into my working directory.
13. touch buildwords.sh
    	This creates a script file in my working directory.
14. emacs buildwords.sh
    	This opens the script file in emacs.
15.#!/bin/sh
	This tells what shell to use.
16.set -x
        This tells the script to print commands that were run.
The following commands are in the script separated by |.

grep '<td>.*</td>'
     Gets everything beginning with <td> and ending with </td>.
sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
     This command removes all tags.
sed 's/ \{4\}//g'
     This command removes tab (four whitespaces) from the input.
tr -s '\n'
     This squeezes new lines and eliminates blank lines.
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
     This replaces uppercase letters with lowercase letters.
tr '`' "'"
     This command replaces ` with '.
sed '1~2d'
     This command removes English words which are on every odd line number.
tr ', ' '\n'
     This separates any Hawaiian words connected by a comma or space into
     separate words.
tr -s '\n'
     This squeezes repeated new lines that were just created.
sort -u
     This sorts the list and removes duplicates.
grep -v "[^pk'mnwlhaeiou]"
     This removes lines that contain characters not in Hawaiian.
17.cat <hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords.sh > hwords
     This uses the script to build hwords, a Hawaiian word dictionary from the
     .htm file 
18.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
     sort -u | comm -23 - hwords
     This tests the Hawaiian spell check on the webpage.
19.cat <hwords | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u
     | comm -23 -hwords
     This tests the Hawaiian spell check on the Hawaiian dictionary.
20.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
     sort -u | comm -23 - words | wc -l
     This counts misspelled English words in the webpage. This counts 39.
21.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
     sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l
     This counts misspelled Hawaiian words in the webpage. This counts 406.
22.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
     sort -u | comm -23 - words >engwords.txt 
     This creates a list of misspelled English words in engwords.txt.
23.cat <assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
     sort -u | comm -23 - hwords >hawwords.txt 
     This creates a list of misspelled Hawaiian words in hawwords.txt.
24.comm -13 engwords.txt hawwords.txt
     This lists words written correctly as English but not in Hawaiian. These
     include word, words, work, working, worry, write.
25.comm -23 engwords.txt hawwords.txt
     This lists words written correctly in Hawaiian but not in English. There
     are three which are: halau, lau, and wiki.
