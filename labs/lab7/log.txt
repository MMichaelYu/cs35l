$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
	I make sure the PATH environment variable is set correctly.

$ sort —-version
	sort (GNU coreutils) 8.25
	I make sure that my version of coreutils is updated past 8.6.

$ cat /dev/urandom | od -A n -t f -N 80000000 | tr -s ' ' '\n' >
randomfloats.txt  
	I make a file with 10000000 random floating points.
	od
	-A n makes it so the offset is not included in the file
	-t f makes it so that they are interpreted as doubles
	-N 80000000 formats 80000000 bytes since we want 10000000 doubles which
are 8 bytes each

	tr
	-s removes multiple occurrences of the newline so we have no empty lines
	
$ sed -i “1d” randomfloats.txt
	I want to delete the first line which is empty

$ time -p sort -g < randomfloats.txt > /dev/null

$ time -p sort -g --parallel=1 <randomfloats.txt > /dev/null

$ time -p sort -g --parallel=2 <randomfloats.txt > /dev/null

$ time -p sort -g --parallel=4 <randomfloats.txt > /dev/null

It seems like the sort command is already parallelized since it has similar
performance to the 8 threaded version.It seems like doubling the threads used
almost halves the time it takes for the command to run.
