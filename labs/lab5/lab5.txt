1. wget
http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz 
I get the bugged version of coreutils.

2. tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
I extract the tar file.

3. cd coreutils-with-bug
   wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/ 
I get the patch file.

4. mkdir bugged
   ./configure
   --prefix=“/u/cs/ugrad/michaely/cs35l/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/bugged” 
I configure it to make in the bugged directory I just created.

5. make
This gives me an error:

6. make install
This gives me an error:

7. patch -p0 < coreutils.diff
I patch coreutils with coreutils.diff

8. make
   make install
Now the patched files are in effect. No errors are produced because the patch
renames the function futimens to curetils_futimens, tee to coreutils_tee, and
any later mentions of those functions. Originally there was conflicting types
for 'futimens'.

9. mkdir testing
   cd testing
   tmp=$(mktemp -d)
   cd $tmp
   touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
   touch now
   sleep 1
   touch now1
   cd	
   cd cs35l/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/bugged/bin
   ./ls -lt /tmp/tmp.3QqjJ25LaK

This reproduces the bug since wwi-armistice is listed first when it should be 
last. 

10. gdb ./ls
    info functions
Relevant functions might be:
static int compare_atime(V, V);
static int compare_ctime(V, V);
static int compare_mtime(V, V);

So I put break points at all three:
break compare_atime
break compare_ctime
break compare_mtime

But run -lt /tmp/tmp.3QqjJ25LaK only stops at compare_mtime. compare_mtime
calls cmp_mtime. So I add a breakpoint with:
break cmp_mtime 
Running again and stepping through I see that timespec_cmp from
lib/timespec.h:48 is called and the line 'int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;' seems
important. 

The full function is:
	timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
{
  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
  return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
}

diff can become a large negative number if b is wwi-armistice and may be the
source of the error.

       cp /u/cs/ugrad/michaely/cs35l/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h
       /u/cs/ugrad/michaely/cs35l/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec2.h 
I copy timespec.h to a file called timespec2.h
       emacs timespec.h
       I edit the file so timespec_cmp can only  pass -1, 0, or 1 and not diff. 
I then build coreutils again with the new file and it works.
       diff -u ./timespec2.h timespec.h > lab5.diff
I create the diff file.
       cd ..
       emacs ChangeLog
       C-x 4 a
Then I wrote a description of the fixed bug.
       
11. mkdir testcase
    cd testcase
    touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
    touch now
    sleep 1
    touch now1
    TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
I get:
-rw-r--r-- 1 michaely csugrad 0 2054-12-17 17:28:16.000000000 +0000
    wwi-armistice 
-rw-r--r-- 1 michaely csugrad 0 2016-10-29 03:19:49.809712000 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 michaely csugrad 0 2016-10-29 03:19:46.245932000 +0000 now

Seasnet doesn't do well because it shows 2054 as the date for wwi-armistice
since it uses unsigned 32-bit time stamps.
