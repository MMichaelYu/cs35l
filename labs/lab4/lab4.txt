cd cs35l/lab4
   I move into my working directory.

1. gitclone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils
   I copy diffutils into my working directory.
cd diffutils
   I move to the diffutils directory.

2. git log > git-log.txt
   I put the log of changes into git-log.txt.

3. git tag > git-tags.txt
   I put the tags into git-tags.txt.

4. emacs git-log.txt
C-s quote 'like Enter
C-p C-p C-p C-p M-b C-SP M-f M-W
    I find and copy the hash for the correct patch in emacs.
C-x C-c
    Then I close emacs.
git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. git checkout v3.0 -b newbranch
   I checkout diffutils v3.0 in a new branch.

6. patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
   I apply the patch for quoting things.

These are the problems I received:
9 out of 9 hunks ignored
Hunk #10 FAILED at 876.
Hunk #11 FAILED at 906.
Hunk #12 FAILED at 942.
Hunk #6 FAILED at 433.
1 out of 9 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file src/diff3.c.rej
patching file src/dir.c

7. git status
   I see that many files have been modified due to the patch.

8. Learning emacs functions

9. emacs <non .c files>
C-x v = C-x v u yes Enter
    I go through and revert all changes to the non .c files.
non .c files: NEWS, README, README-hacking, TODO, cfg.mk, doc/diagmeet.note,
   ms/config.bat, ms/config.site, po/en.po, src/diff.h, src/system.h,
   tests/help-version 
emacs <.c files>
C-x v = C-u C-c C-a
    I go through each hunk and decide whether to keep or delete the files
   depending on if the changes affected character strings.
.c files: src/analyze.c, src/cmp.c, src/context.c, src/diff.c, src/diff3.c,
   src/dir.c, src/ifdef.c, src/io.c, src/sdiff.c, src/side.c, src/util.c 

10. I manually type in rejected patches from src/diff3.c.rej and src/diff.c.rej
 
11. git clean -f
    I remove untracked files.

12. git status
    I make sure that there are a half dozen modified files.
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
    I put the changes into a file.

13. export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
    This finds the help2man program needed for bootstrap.
./bootstrap
wgets http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
      I apply an extra patch after ./bootstrap and before ./configure.
./configure
make 
make check
     These were the instructions on building diffutils.

14. cd..
    I go to my lab4 directory.
mkdir diffutils-3.0
mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch
cd diffutils
cp -r ./src ../diffutils-3.0-patch
   I copy the modified diffutils source to diffutils-3.0-patch.
git checkout -f v3.0
cp -r ./src ../diffutils-3.0
   I copy the unmodified 3.0 diffutils source to diffutils-3.0.
cd ..
./diffutils-3.0-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0/src diffutils-3.0-patch/src
    >quote-3.0-test.txt 
    I compare the source codes and information can be foud in
    quote-3.0-test.txt.

15. diff quote-3.0-test.txt ./diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
    Comparing the two files, they are not the same but the differences are
    innocuous.
