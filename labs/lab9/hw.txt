1.It would still be secure since the other team still does not have the private key needed to decrypt the bytes they receive. 
Since they cannot gain any information from it, the network is still secure.
(1) If the other team tapped the keyboards and knew all the strokes the network would not be secure. 
The other team could easily get our password and login with that. But if I turn off Password Authentication then the network is still secure.
(2) If the other team had control of the usb we boot off of then the network is insecure too because 
they can just find the private key on the usb and decrypt everything.
2. gpg â€”verify is not able to check if I am the creator of the tar since it only verifies the digital signature 
and if the file had been changed since it was packaged. A signature being verified does not tell if the file was 
created since signing a document is not the same as creating it. 
A digital certificate would fix this problem since it comes from a secured authority. 
The certificate includes the public key, the signature, and the name of the owner which can be used to verify who is the creator.
